Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm Ermia Ghaffari, currently studying Information and Communication Technology at KTH, Stockholm. This GitHub repository serves as a showcase for the projects I've worked on during my academic journey and personal endeavors. I've been immersing myself in web development, with a focus on modern front-end technologies such as React and various JavaScript libraries. My passion is primarily in user interface development, and I am expanding my horizons to include mobile, server-side, and desktop application development.
Looking to the future, I am intrigued by the potential of AI and machine learning, and I plan to integrate these into my upcoming projects. So, stay tuned for some exciting AI-related updates!
