Greetings from my corner of GitHub! I'm Ermia Ghaffari, pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology at KTH in Stockholm. This repository is a window into the diverse array of projects that have marked my educational path and personal pursuits. My recent adventures have been in the realm of web development, with a special emphasis on cutting-edge front-end technologies like React, Redux and a variety of JavaScript frameworks. Crafting user interfaces is where my enthusiasm truly lies, and I'm eagerly extending my skill set to embrace the development of mobile apps, server-side solutions, and desktop software.

As I peer into the technological horizon, the fascinating world of AI and machine learning beckons. I'm gearing up to weave these transformative technologies into my future endeavors. Stay connected for a series of engaging updates centered around AI and its applications!
